    "installation_instructions": "# How to integrate eesel AI into Zendesk\n\n## Step 1. Set up an [eesel AI account](https://dashboard.eesel.ai/api/auth/signup?returnTo=v2)\n\n[![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1138570084/a649c7c739573b847510d079/image.png?expires=1723104000&signature=eeb8fa9a7f603ed193bbc3dfaeceb865a59e78c1ff3aad56d59248b47802a5c5)](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1138570084/a649c7c739573b847510d079/image.png?expires=1723104000&signature=eeb8fa9a7f603ed193bbc3dfaeceb865a59e78c1ff3aad56d59248b47802a5c5)\n\n## Step 2. Train your eesel AI bot on relevant \"Sources\"\n\neesel AI works with \"Sources\" and \"Destinations\". You can train it on different \"Sources\" like your Zendesk Help Center, and plug it into different \"Destinations\" like your Zendesk as an AI agent, or as a chat bubble.\n\n[![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1138571069/6eda460156085277609f8eb6/image.png?expires=1723104000&signature=ba2c0fb35d6c5cabb952dbc03607d7062ee209ac32f3e4d65624568307a16d40)](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1138571069/6eda460156085277609f8eb6/image.png?expires=1723104000&signature=ba2c0fb35d6c5cabb952dbc03607d7062ee209ac32f3e4d65624568307a16d40)\n\nTo start, let's train on your Zendesk Help Center.\n\n[![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1138572868/16e6ca1e5b545fccf38087ca/image.png?expires=1723104000&signature=469e66736353402234d7f944d431b8f278139987946f5a124cb2ee253fb4a2fd)](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1138572868/16e6ca1e5b545fccf38087ca/image.png?expires=1723104000&signature=469e66736353402234d7f944d431b8f278139987946f5a124cb2ee253fb4a2fd)\n\n## Step 3. Chat with the bot in the Dashboard\n\nHere you can start tinkering with the bot and it will give you answers based on the \"Sources\" you have added. You can add PDFs, CSV files, Google Docs and so on as Sources.\n\n[![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1138575342/81287fa9cf0f61905f0d0974/image.png?expires=1723104000&signature=7cec799342e4d305e11a08671e06ba4dcb8cd9c90b2781af3864168e1ec51006)](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1138575342/81287fa9cf0f61905f0d0974/image.png?expires=1723104000&signature=7cec799342e4d305e11a08671e06ba4dcb8cd9c90b2781af3864168e1ec51006)\n\n## Step 4. Add a \"Destination\"\n\nDestinations are what you plug your bot into. For instance, you can make a Chat Bubble.\n\n[![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1138576546/47987cb6686b04876714e94c/image.png?expires=1723104000&signature=bdf90ded48301b84f006e4ff8868f9b179f1cfb47fd432f722b60b8839624cc8)](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1138576546/47987cb6686b04876714e94c/image.png?expires=1723104000&signature=bdf90ded48301b84f006e4ff8868f9b179f1cfb47fd432f722b60b8839624cc8)\n\nYou can also insert this into Slack.\n\n[![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1138577069/eeaa1c6874536b3345df70ec/image.png?expires=1723104000&signature=a4f20e95b566638ec3e80de7266153bf28b3e411f73f79d4f72147e1aaaa7c56)](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1138577069/eeaa1c6874536b3345df70ec/image.png?expires=1723104000&signature=a4f20e95b566638ec3e80de7266153bf28b3e411f73f79d4f72147e1aaaa7c56)\n\nQuestions?
